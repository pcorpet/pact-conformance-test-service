# PACT Automated Conformance Tool

### About this Project
PACT publishes  [Technical Specifications for PCF Data Exchange](https://docs.carbon-transparency.org/v2/), which any organization or company can implement. Software solutions that implement the PACT Technical Specifications are known as [PACT Conformant Solutions](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/network). This GitHub repository creates an Automated Conformance Testing service which enables organizations to become PACT Conformant.

###  Context
PACT began running a conformance testing process in May 2023, shortly after the publication of V2 of the PACT Technical Specifications. From May 2023 to February 2025, conformance is conducted through manual peer-to-peer testing, [learn more here](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/guides/guide-join-pact-network). PACT is now developing an Automated Conformance Testing Service, which will both facilitate testing and improve the rigor and reliability of PACT Conformance status.

### Timeline
- Several organizations have proposed automated conformance testing since PACT's foundation, including [SINE Foundation](https://sine.foundation/) and [NRI](https://www.nri.com/en/index.html).
- NRI [Takuro Okada](mailto:t2-okada@nri.co.jp) built an open-source command-line automated conformance testing tool and released this to the PACT community in September 2024, [see here](https://github.com/wbcsd/pact-api-testbed)
- PACT began work on this project in January 2025
- PACT is building an MVP version of the service, planned to be ready for testing March 2025
- PACT plans to launch a Production version of the service in May 2025, following the launch of PACT Tech Specs V3, helping organizations conform to V3

### How to test MVP
- Any organization globally may participate in testing ACT MVP, provided the organization has built or is buiding a PACT Conformant Solution implementing PACT Tech Specs V2.X.X. There is no cost to participate in testing.
- Testing is estimated to take no more than 1 hour, assuming the organization has a Solution already built and ready for testing
- Why test? Gain early access to the service, provide feedback to influence the direction of the service post MVP, be promoted as an early tester of the MVP, prepare to quickly pass conformance when the ACT becomes mandatory (for V3)
- To test ACT MVP, you need a registration code, please email Beth Hadley (hadley@wbcsd.org) for a code.
