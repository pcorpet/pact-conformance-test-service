# PACT Automated Conformance Tool

### About this Project
PACT publishes  [Technical Specifications for PCF Data Exchange](https://docs.carbon-transparency.org/v2/), which any organization or company can implement. Software solutions that implement the PACT Technical Specifications are known as [PACT Conformant Solutions](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/network). This GitHub repository creates an Automated Conformance Testing service which enables organizations to become PACT Conformant.

###  Context
PACT began running a conformance testing process in May 2023, shortly after the publication of V2 of the PACT Technical Specifications. From May 2023 to February 2025, conformance is conducted through manual peer-to-peer testing, [learn more here](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/guides/guide-join-pact-network). PACT is now developing an Automated Conformance Testing Service, which will both facilitate testing and improve the rigor and reliability of PACT Conformance status.

### Timeline
- Several organizations have proposed automated conformance testing since PACT's foundation, including [SINE Foundation](https://sine.foundation/) and [NRI](https://www.nri.com/en/index.html).
- NRI [Takuro Okada](mailto:t2-okada@nri.co.jp) built an open-source command-line automated conformance testing tool and released this to the PACT community in September 2024, [see here](https://github.com/wbcsd/pact-api-testbed)
- PACT began work on this project in January 2025
- PACT is building an MVP version of the service, planned to be ready for testing March 2025
- PACT plans to launch a Production version of the service in May 2025, following the launch of PACT Tech Specs V3, helping organizations conform to V3
