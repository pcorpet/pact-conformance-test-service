# PACT Automated Conformance Tool

### About this Project
PACT publishes  [Technical Specifications for PCF Data Exchange](https://docs.carbon-transparency.org/v2/), which any organization or company can implement. Software solutions that implement the PACT Technical Specifications are known as [PACT Conformant Solutions](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/network). This GitHub repository creates an Automated Conformance Testing service which enables organizations to become PACT Conformant.

###  Context
PACT began running a conformance testing process in May 2023, shortly after the publication of V2 of the PACT Technical Specifications. From May 2023 to February 2025, conformance was conducted through manual peer-to-peer testing, [learn more here](https://www.carbon-transparency.org/guides/guide-join-pact-network). PACT is now developing an Automated Conformance Testing Service, which will both facilitate testing and improve the rigor and reliability of PACT Conformance status.

### Access the tool
We encourage anyone to use the tool! See [Testing Guide](docs/MVP_testing_guide.md)

### Timeline
- PACT released an MVP version of the service in March 2025, which can now be used for testing. 
- PACT will release a production version of the service in June 2025, which must be used to gain PACT Conformance status
