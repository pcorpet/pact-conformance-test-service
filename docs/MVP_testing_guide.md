# Guide to testing Automated Conformance Testing MVP

## Why participate in testing?
- Organizations that participate in MVP testing of ACT will gain early access to the service, provide feedback to influence its direction, be promoted as early testers of the MVP, and be well-prepared to quickly pass conformance when the ACT becomes mandatory
- Any organization globally may participate in testing ACT MVP, provided the organization has built or is building a PACT Conformant Solution implementing PACT Tech Specs V2.X.X. There is no cost to participate in testing.
- Testing is estimated to take no more than 1 hour, assuming the organization has a solution already built and ready for testing

## How to join testing?
To test ACT MVP you need a registration code, please email Beth Hadley (hadley@wbcsd.org) for a code.

## Timeline for testing?
The MVP testing phase is from March 20 - April 2, 2025.

## Pre-requisites to testing
Before beginning testing, organizations must complete the following pre-requisites:
- Build a PACT Conformant Solution (or at least partial PACT Conformant Solution) based on [PACT Tech Specs](https://docs.carbon-transparency.org/) Version 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, or 2.3: 
- Configure your solution to be able to authenticate Action Event requests using the following credentials:
  - clientId: `test_client_id`
  - clientSecret: `test_client_secret`

## Testing Instructions
- Register to [PACT Network](https://pact-directory-portal.onrender.com/) to begin testing. Note that not all information is strictly required to conduct conformance testing, but as ACT is built in the same environment as Identity Management, the sign-up interfaces are similar. We are refining the sign-up UI for public launch and welcome your feedback.
- You are taken to a page with your company profile. The pages "My Profile", "Search", and "Manage Connections" are functionality of the PACT Identity Management service, which you are welcome to explore and test but are not relevant to Automated Conformance Testing. See [Identity Management GitHub](https://github.com/wbcsd/pact-directory).
- Go to "Conformance Testing"
- Enter in details, and click "Run tests"; the rest should be self-explanatory
- Make note of your feedback (questions, comments, etc.) and once you have completed testing, please write to Beth Hadley (hadley@wbcsd.org) to share your feedback and schedule a call to de-brief
- We look forward to your feedback and revising the MVP accordingly!
